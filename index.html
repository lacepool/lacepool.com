      <h2>ADA staking</h2>

      <p>Staking is a win-win for you and the Cardano network: it generates passive income for you and  supports the decentralization effect in the Cardano network.</p>

      <p>If you own ADA, you can start staking. You will receive rewards (in ADA) that are paid every epoch (5 days).</p>

      <p>The only thing you need to do is keep your ADA in a wallet that supports staking. The most popular ones are the <a href="https://daedaluswallet.io/" target="_blank">Daedalus</a> and <a href="https://yoroi-wallet.com/" taget="_blank">Yoroi</a> wallets. For security reasons, never leave your ADA on an exchange for an extended period of time.</p>

      <p>In your wallet you choose a stake pool from the list and delegate your ADA. This is 100% risk-free as delegating is like an assignment but you're not transferring your ADA to anyone. Your ADA assets stay safe with you in your wallet and you can still use them at any time.</p>

      <p>Note: A deposit of 2 ADA will be paid. This ensures that you can pay the transaction fees for paying out rewards even if your wallet is completely empty. Redelegation does not require another deposit, but be aware it is a transaction and you'll pay a transaction fee.</p>

      <p>If you are delegating your ADA for the first time and want to understand when to expect the first rewards, please check out the following graphic.</p>

      <h2>Open Source Software Fund</h2>

      <p>Almost everyone uses Open Source Software on a daily basis. What many people don't know: Those who develop tools millions of us use every day are often volunteers.

      <p>This fund is supposed to support the people behind Open Source Software projects and to incentivize new people to join them.</p>

      <p>Every month 25% of the stake pool's net profits are moved over to the fund. There is no disadvantage for you as it doesn't lower your rewards.</p>

      <p>Currently, allocation of the funds is a curated, continuosly reviewed and adjusted process. In the future smart contracts will supersede this manual work.</p>

      <p>The funds are payed out to the projects through <a href="https://github.com/sponsors" target="_blank">GitHub sponsors</a> as recurring, monthly donations.</p>

      <p>Following projects are considered to receive donations from the fund as soon as it has grown to a valuable size.</p>

      <h2>Pool details</h2>

      <p>All nodes are running on Ubuntu machines with 16GB RAM and 4 CPU cores. They communicate through a private network and only the relays connect to other peers in the Cardano network shielding the block producing node.<p>

      <p>Lacepool's keys were securely created in an air gapped environment, encrypted and have been kept in a safe place ever since.</p>

      <p>The servers are located in a highly secure and professional datacenter in Frankfurt, Germany. The provider is known for its excellent cloud computing services and since the deployment of the nodes is based on Docker, scaling server resources vertically and horizontally is a breeze.</p>
